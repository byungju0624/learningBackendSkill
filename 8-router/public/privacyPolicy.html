          Information. Personal Information is information that identifies you
          or another person, such as your first name and last name, physical
          addresses, email addresses, telephone, fax, SSN, information stored
          within your device.<br />b. Non-personal Information. We collect your

          Information and therefore we do not disclose your Personal
          Information.<br />b. Non-Personal Information. We do not sell, trade,
          or otherwise transfer to outside parties your information. We do not
          combine Non-Personal Information with Personal Information (such as

          Controller and Data Processor<br /><br />In accordance with GDPR, we
          set our duty on data controller and data processor. Data controllers
          decide the "purposes" and "means" of any processing of personal data.
          Similar to what's already in place for data protection law today, data
          controllers will have to adopt compliance measures to cover how data
          is collected, what it is being used for, how long it is being retained
          for and ensure that people have a right to access the data held about
          them. Data processors handle personal data on behalf of a data
          controller. Certain obligations now apply directly to data processors,
          and controllers must bind them to certain contractual commitments to
          ensure that data is processed safely and legally.<br /><br />Security<br />MondayOFF
          Inc. is very concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your
